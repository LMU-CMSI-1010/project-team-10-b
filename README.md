- THE UNITED STATES OF HANG MAN

The United States of Hangman is our own version of the traditional hangman. It is a state-guessing game. The computer chooses a secret a state,
and the person playing tries to guess it. When the player guesses a letter that isnâ€™t in the state name, it loses a point and the computer draws 
part of a stick-man for each wrong guess. However, the player has the option of having a hint (the hint is a stereotype of the state), but if it 
takes the hint, the computer will draw a part of the stick-man.
