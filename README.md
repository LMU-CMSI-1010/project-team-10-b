- THE UNITED STATES OF HANG MAN

The United States of Hangman is our own version of the traditional hangman. It is a state-guessing game. The computer chooses a secret a state,
and the person playing tries to guess it. When the player guesses a letter that isnâ€™t in the state name,the computer draws part of a stick-man for each wrong guess. However, the player has the option of having a hint (the hint is a stereotype of the state), but if it 
takes the hint, the computer will draw a part of the stick-man. The person playing wins when they guess the correct state. 
Our game also gives you the option to quit or reset the game. If the player clicks on the x icon at the to of the screen the game will quit, and same thing with the reset button, if the player clicks on in the game will restart.
